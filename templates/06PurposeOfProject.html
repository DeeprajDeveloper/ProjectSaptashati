                    Hi üëã, I'm Deepraj Adhikary, the creator of this website.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I come from a Hindu-Brahmin family where priesthood has been a long-standing tradition. I had my Upanayana Samskara 
                    (<hindi>‡§â‡§™‡§®‡§Ø‡§® ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞</hindi>) at the age of 13, marking my initiation into the fascinating world of Sanskrit‚Äîa passion that has stayed
                    with me ever since. Sanskrit, unfortunately, is a dying language in India, and I want to play a small but meaningful
                    role in keeping it alive in the hearts and minds of those enthusiastic about learning it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I'm a Technical Business Analyst with the mind of a Software Developer and the meticulousness of a
                    Quality Assurance Tester. I have been working at a multinational corporation for the past six years. Currently, I live
                    in Toronto, Canada, but I was born in Tamluk (West Bengal, India) and grew up in Hyderabad (Telangana, India).

                <p>
                    The goal of this website is to make the rich spiritual teachings and practices of the Devi Saptashati accessible to
                    everyone. Whether you're new to this sacred text or already familiar with it, this project is here to guide you. Many
                    people feel overwhelmed by the complexity of rituals like the Chandi Path. This website simplifies the process, offering
                    step-by-step guidance so anyone can perform these practices with clarity and devotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Devi Saptashati is a treasure of our cultural and spiritual heritage. This project is my effort to keep that legacy
                    alive and ensure that future generations can connect with it in meaningful ways. The rituals and teachings of the Devi
                    Saptashati are not just about tradition; they offer a path to spiritual growth, inner strength, and a deeper connection
                    with the divine power of the Goddess.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This platform is designed to be a simple and reliable resource for learning the chants, stotras, and the profound
                    meanings behind the Devi Saptashati. Whether you're reciting on your own or in a group, you'll find everything you need
                    here. Sacred texts can often feel inaccessible due to language barriers or their inherent complexity. By providing
                    translations, explanations, and guidance, this website ensures that everyone‚Äîregardless of their background‚Äîcan benefit
                    from these teachings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is more than just a website; it's a space for people who share a love for Goddess Durga to come together, learn,
                    and grow. It's about celebrating devotion as a collective experience.
                    
                    The Devi Saptashati is not merely a collection of rituals; it's filled with timeless wisdom about overcoming challenges,
                    finding balance, and living a purposeful life. This project delves into those teachings to show how they remain relevant
                    in today's world.
                    
                    At its heart, this project is a celebration of Shakti, the divine feminine energy that sustains and empowers the
                    universe. It is about inspiring devotion and reverence for this boundless power.
